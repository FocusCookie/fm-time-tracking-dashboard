- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Custom Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements)

### What I learned

I wanted to understand how frameworks like react and vue are buld upon. So I decided to create my own web custom elements from scratch. It was really fun! I can now appreached even more what the frameworks are doin for your and how much easier it is to archive databinding for instance :).

### Useful resources
